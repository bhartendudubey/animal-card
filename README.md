# animal-card


Using the basic knowledge of HTML & CSS, I had created the design of a "Animal Trading Card".
I created it under Udacity-Google India Challenge as my first project.

>>SPECIFICATIONS:
The HTML includes classes that are used for styling(Classes are given meaningful names).
I had Separated HTML from CSS by linking to stylesheet.


The basic idea of how the webpage looks like on opening in a web browser is given in the file "design-prototype.png".
HTML & CSS for the same are in "card.html" & "styles.css" respectively.
