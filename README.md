# animal-card


Using the basic knowledge of HTML & CSS, I had created the design of a "Animal Trading Card".
I created it under Udacity-Google India Challenge as my first project.

>>SPECIFICATIONS:
The HTML includes classes that are used for styling(Classes are given meaningful names).
I had Separated HTML from CSS by linking to stylesheet.
